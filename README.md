*First year , second semester  java group project in the university. The technologies are Java , JavaFX , SceneBuilder , JDBC , Mysql*

Financial management is essential for university students. We especially need it nowadays 
in a moment when our country is facing a terrible economic crisis. Sometimes we spend 
money carelessly without considering our income and how much cash is left with us. To 
address this problem that we all face on a daily basis, we made a software solution.
It will show how much money is available with us at any time we want to know it. As a 
result, we don't need to spend our time on all these calculations. Only thing we have to 
do is input our incomes and also our expenses about meals, transport, others etc. When 
we input a new income to the software, it will update and increase the total cash available 
with us. When we input details about our expenses, it will update and decrease the total 
cash available. This way, when we open our software, we can come to know how much 
cash we have at the moment. All the incomes we input and the date of the input will store 
to a MySQL database. All the expenses we input and the date of the inputs will also be 
stored in the database. As a result, we can see all the records of incomes and expenses any 
time we want. Also, it will be very helpful to us because the date of each input is also 
automatically added to each record in the database. Gaining information about how we 
spend our money will help us to take actions for financial safety.!
